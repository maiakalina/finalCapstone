Sentiment Analysis Programme

This Python programme performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon consumer reviews using the TextBlob library and spaCy.

Installation
Before running the programme, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
spacy
textblob

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas spacy textblob

Additionally, you'll need to download the English language model for spaCy:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

Usage
1. Import Libraries:
Import the required libraries at the beginning of your Python script:

import pandas as pd
import spacy
from textblob import TextBlob

2. Load Data:
Load the dataset containing Amazon consumer reviews:

data = pd.read_csv("path/to/dataset.csv")

3. Perform Sentiment Analysis:
Define a function to perform sentiment analysis on each review:

def analyse_sentiment(review):
    analysis = TextBlob(str(review))
    sentiment = analysis.sentiment.polarity
    print(f"Review: {review}")
    print(f"Sentiment Polarity: {sentiment}")
    return sentiment
    
4. Apply Sentiment Analysis:
Apply the sentiment analysis function to each review in the dataset:

data['sentiment'] = data['reviews.text'].dropna().apply(analyse_sentiment)

5. Calculate Mean Polarity:
Calculate the mean polarity of the sentiment scores:

mean_polarity = data['sentiment'].mean()
print(f"Mean Polarity: {mean_polarity}")

6. Calculate Semantic Similarity:
Choose two indices of the reviews to compare and calculate the semantic similarity between them using spaCy:

index1 = 67  # Index of the first review
index2 = 120 # Index of the second review

review1 = data['reviews.text'].iloc[index1]
review2 = data['reviews.text'].iloc[index2]

doc1 = nlp(review1)
doc2 = nlp(review2)

similarity = doc1.similarity(doc2)
print(f"Semantic similarity between review {index1} and review {index2}: {similarity}")

Notes

1. Replace "path/to/dataset.csv" with the path to your dataset file.
2. Ensure that the dataset contains a column named 'reviews.text' containing the reviews.
3. This programme utilises the English language model (en_core_web_md) provided by spaCy. Ensure that it is downloaded before running the programme.
